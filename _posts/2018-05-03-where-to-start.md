This blog is a reset on my writing and what my interests have focused on but it's so hard to figure out what to write
and leave available for everyone to see.

What happened to my other stuff?  It wasn't worth keeping around but it's probably all floating around somewhere on
the Internet. Google it? It has all floated away. Content disappearing is not mysterious because I really don't have
it anymore.

I am currently working at at a software company that uses a lot of Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Elixir.  It's all pretty
cool stuff but I have lately been bored. Bored? Yes. How do I combat it? Mostly things outside of technology like
traveling, practicing music or drawing but I am trying to stay on the positive side and push my way through it.

If you've read this far, thanks for doing it!
