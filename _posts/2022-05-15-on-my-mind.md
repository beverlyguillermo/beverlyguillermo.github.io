# May 2022 - On My Mind

Lately, it's all about habits and I am trying to pick healthier habits and improve my concentration.  I know everyone
has lists, but it does help to write and share to have some accountability, so I may write about any of the following
topics later.

The follow things have been on my mind lately.

Topics on Distributed Computing:

- Conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT)
- Automerge

Improving my programming language knowledge:

- Rust
- Golang
- Scala

Various other topics:

- Handwriting recognition
