I have been developing with Mac and Linux machines forever but I wanted to try out the new Windows Subsystem for Linux
Preview, or WSL for a while. I was able to get a Surface Pro 8.

Disclaimer, these are <i>fragments</i> of my thoughts.  I am not really planning on creating a step-by-step tutorial or
a review, but more of observation notes about things I've encountered and what I found useful while playing around with
Windows 11 and Surface Pro 8.


## Hardware and Software:

- Surface Pro 8, Intel Evo i5, 256GB
- Surface Slim Pen 2
- Surface Pro Signature Keyboard Cover
- Windows 11 Home

I am fan of the pen. What surprised me though is the price and you don't get to charge it with the table alone.  You
either have to get a separate charger or get the Signature Keyboard.

I've had the Surface Pro 4 in the past, and I really liked it for what it was at the time.  The Surface Pro 8 is
an improvement and I was happy about it coming with usbc.

### IntelliJ

I love the debugger, profiling tools and autocompletion with Intellij.  Yes, I could just use vim but for all the
languages I use, there is an Intellij plugin that is super useful.  It <i>IS</i> a memory hog though and I found that
syncing my settings that I've used with my mac or linux really halts the surface that I had.

### NetLimiter

I love little snitch on my Mac.  I am all right with the net-tools on Linux.  I just wanted to try Netlimiter because
it would give me a better understanding of my Windows apps and their communications out of my network.

### Krita

Having a Surface, I wanted to try out the pen with some drawing app.  Krita is open-source, has lot of tools, and it's
interface is not bad.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux Preview (Microsoft Store)

The tool I really wanted to try out from Microsoft.  It was so easy to setup.

### Linux Distribution (Microsoft Store)

Some available distributions:

- Ubuntu (Installed)
- Debian
- openSUSE
- Kali

### PowerToys via Microsoft Store

- [Git](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) - help remap Caps Lock to Escape and vice versa

### Docker Desktop For Windows

I really wanted to use Docker. It uses WSL, and WSL was the only way for Docker to run on Windows 11 Home.  I would
wonder if the having Windows 11 Pro would give me better performance.

## Accessing the WSL Folders
Running docker, it was best for any source files to be in the WSL folders' home directory.  I found out you can access
from Windows Explorer or IDE, using:

`\\wsl$\[DISTRIBUTION]\home\[USERNAME]`

## Ubuntu

These are some specific ubuntu things.  After running `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade`.

### Fish

Adding fish shell... just to see what it was like in WSL

## Notes

I think I started trying to configure the Surface around 13:00pm ET, and spent quite a while on Krita and then setting
up the development environment.

- 18:56pm: I had everything installed that I wanted, and the memory is already at 90% on startup. I read that this is
expected on Windows 11?  So I pushed on to try some coding.
- 21:20pm: I spent an hour with docker desktop and trying to pull an image, for some reason it locked up. Restarting
the Surface fixed it.
- 21:50pm: I don't think that 8GB is really enough to do any kind of development work. Maybe 16gb would work, but I
found that if I have my editor and docker it may work.  I probably couldn't have a lot of browser tabs though. :P
